The Digilient starter code is a bit strange in using blocking assignments (=)
in sequential blocks (posedge blocks). For example:
https://github.com/Digilent/Basys3/blob/master/Projects/Abacus/src/hdl/Divider.v#L52,
but there are many such examples.

The Vivado BFT tutorial on the other hand only uses non-blocking assignments in
sequential blocks. So overall, I think we should stick to blocking assignments
in combinational blocks and non-blocking assignments in sequential blocks even
if other combinations are legal.

This logic analyzer (courtesy Amit) seems really worth buying:
