1. This contains a pretty good set of debugging aids for implementing a UART receiver
(http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html)

2. Using a lower baud rate makes things more debugging because signals last longer.

3. Flashing an LED for an instant doesn't help with debugging because it doesn't persist
long enough.

4. The CYCLES_PER_SAMPLE, FULL_BIT, and HALF_BIT parameters need to be updated
every time the clock rate or baud rate changes.

5. Using multiple LEDs to show multi-bit patterns is a reasonable way to get output while
debuggin the UART receiver itself.
