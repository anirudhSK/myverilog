Mon Feb 19 TODOs:

1. Get Verilog file after synthesis somehow.
2. Understand everything in the timing report, especially the r's on some lines.
3. Correlate the timing report against the post-synthesis Verilog file.
4. Understand this document: https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2015_1/ug906-vivado-design-analysis.pdf
