2. Understand everything in the timing report, especially the r's on some lines.
The rs mean rising delay according to: https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2015_1/ug906-vivado-design-analysis.pdf
Page 195 of that document has quite some detail on timing analysis.

https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee183/handouts_spr2003/lecture5_spring2003.pdf is a pretty clear description of setup hold times etc.

3. Correlate the timing report against the post-synthesis Verilog file.
